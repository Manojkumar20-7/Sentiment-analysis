<h1>Sentiment-analysis</h1>
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on textual data using Python and Flask. Sentiment analysis involves the process of determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in a piece of text. Flask, a micro web framework for Python, is used to create a web application to interact with the sentiment analysis functionality.
